- Integrated that DLL into an Electron/Vue.js app for direct communication
- Remade [GP Roofing's](https://gp-roofing.net/) website for the modern age, bringing responsive elements of browsers to allow for ease of mobile viewing.
- [New version](https://gp-roofing.vercel.app/)

#### Idaho Virtualization Lab
##### October 2023 - May 2024
- Created 3D models from Micro-CT scans of vertebrate specimens and transferred them to Blender
- Utilized machine learning to train image segmentation models for bone recognition in Micro-CT scan data
- Assisted in discovering patterns to enhance scientific understanding of small vertebrate. 

#### CEADS Research Group
##### May 2023 - August 2023
- Conducted research on red-hat attack algorithms aimed at reducing the accuracy of neural network classification models
- Collaborated with a team to optimize attack methodologies
- Employed data science techniques to perform experiments and generate graphs and diagrams of results
- Presented findings weekly to a group of 15+ team members and stakeholders
- Funded through CAES in collaboration with ISU and the INL

### Skills
#### Programming Languages
Python, JavaScript, SQL, C, C++, Golang

#### Technologies
GitHub, GraphQL, TensorFlow, NumPy, Firebase, Vercel, Docker, Git, Godot

#### Frameworks
Next, React, Express, Node.js (3 years of Node)

#### Platforms
Linux, Windows

### Projects
#### EchoPoint
EchoPoint is a location-based app that lets users receive 'echoes' when they are within range of other posted echoes
- Golang backend: Manages echo processing, collection, and user authentication

#### Min-Max Algorithm Game Visualizations
Implemented and visualized the Min-Max algorithm in a Qt-based C++ application as part of a group project.
- Underlying structure for board display
- Checkers minmax.

#### [Events Calendar Web Scraping](https://github.com/ZacSchepis/public-apis)
Gathering data from ISUs event calendar from HTML format into a structured JSON format

#### Utility Discord Bot
My first long-term project is the ISU ACM club discord bot. Node.js
- Message logging: edit/delete message updates
- ISU event posting: posts upcoming events each day
- User affiliation identification: using a password system, users are able to choose their affiliation to a club/server if it is set up there.

#### [Lazy Linear Algebra](https://github.com/ZacSchepis/Random-Projects/tree/main/LazyLinearAlgebra)
A Node.js-based program that provides a coding-style approach to solving linear algebra problems. Developed during my linear algebra course to verify calculations and reinforce my understanding of key concepts

#### Lottery Scheduler in C
Implemented a lottery-based process scheduler in XV6 as part of my Operating Systems courework

#### [Portfolio Website](https://www.zackaryschepis.com.co/)
Currently a work in progressâ€”updates are planned once I have more time to refine it.

#### [Package Version Checker](https://github.com/ZacSchepis/Grants-Retribution)
Built using Bash, Linux, and Python
- Created a version checker using Python to ensure all packages needed were within a version number to use JupyterLab on an HPC GPU cluster
- Optimized package version verification for JupyterLab on an HPC GPU cluster, reducing login time for 50+ researchers and students from 86 seconds to under 0.005 seconds.

#### [Searching Automation](https://github.com/ZacSchepis/Random-Projects/tree/main/Daily%20Searches)
A thrown together python script that will enter random searches into your search engine of choice. Python.
